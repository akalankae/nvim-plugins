# How the plugins with lazy.nvim work?

Core functionality is in module "core.lua".
Require statement that imports the plugin (in user configuration) imports "init.lua" file.

This file defines 3 functions:
1. init()
- This is the function that runs the module and does all of its functionality.

2. config()
- This function combines default options and options user wants to customize. Options user
  wants customized come in the form of a table generated by lazy.nvim plugin manager.
- Then this function runs above init() function.

3. setup({useropts}) -> {allopts}
- This function does the exact same as config() function.
- Only differences are that,
    a) this takes a table of user options as a parameter
    b) returns a table created by combining user options and default options.
